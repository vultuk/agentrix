When generating a worktree things can take a long time, especially with all the additional steps we now have (such as running the init script). As such, when someone clicks the button to create a worktree (either normally or with a plan) it should offset this to a backend task runner. The frontend should show the progress, showing each step (e.g. creating worktree, running init script, etc). Only once the full process has completed should the terminal (or codex/cursor/Claude) be shown. It should be intuitive and verbose (e.g. a drop-down to see the current progress of a stage).
