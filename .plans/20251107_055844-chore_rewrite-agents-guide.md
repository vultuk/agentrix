Please completely empty the AGENTS.md file and write it again from scratch. Make sure it is aware of how to run commands like linting and testing (using npm) and that it should do it regularly while developing, the folder structures, ensuring the application is SOLID and DRY and using TDD at all times when developing.

Don't make the new file too large as AGENTS.md files are much better when succinct and direct.
