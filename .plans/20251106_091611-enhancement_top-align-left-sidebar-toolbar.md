We need some changes to the UI design. First of all, please can you start in the left sidebar, instead of a toolbar at the bottom please can you move it to the top. It should be the same height as the toolbar from the main section so it matches. On the left it should have the Add Repo button (just changed to a symbol only) and next to that a logout button. On mobile only, there should be a close button that closes the side bar, that button should be on the right hand side of the header.
